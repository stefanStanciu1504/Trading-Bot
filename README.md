Trading Bot <br />
Developed an application that uses a trading platform's API (xStation) and it's purpose is to automatically make transactions
based on the user's input and the current state of the market.<br />
My application, MoneyTrading, features an user interface from which the consumer can login
into their account on xStation, using their password and account number. After a successful authentication, they can select on which markets to start making transactions and, most
importantly, how and when to make the desired transactions. These user’s choices are processed by an algorithm that determines, based on the conditions from the input, if a trade
request needs to be made. Once the trading information is provided then it is sent to xStation platform using XTB’s API.
